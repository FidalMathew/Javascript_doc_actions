<h1>For...of</h1>

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array,
array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.
It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.
